$ Count-config
    Welcome to the configuration procedure of Count 2.2
    ---------------------------------------------------

    o You must know where your system keeps CGI programs (cgi-bin directory)
      It is necessary to generate the install program.
      This directory must exist. If this directory does not exist, the
      configuration procedure will Abort!

    o You have to decide a directory, where you will keep all counter related
      stuff. This directory will have other directories inside. Default
      values will be supplied, press Return key to accept the default value.
      Accept the default value, it will make your life much easier.

    During installation, the directories will be created for you
    if they do not exist and if you have the permission to do so.
    ++
Continue [y|n]? y

    You need to enter the full path of the directory where you system
    keeps the CGI programs. This directory must exist!

*cgi-bin dierctory [/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin]: 

    You need to enter the base directory of the counter related stuff.

*Base directory [/usr/local/etc/Counter]: 

    You need to enter the directory of the configuration file.

* Config directory [/usr/local/etc/Counter/conf]: 

    You need to enter the name of the configuration file.
    This file contains the information about

        o if you want to ignore access from certain hosts
        o host acccess authentication

    You will create this file later by running the program "Gen_conf".

* Name of the configuration file [count.conf]: 
              
    You need to enter the directory of the counter data file.
    
*Data directory [/usr/local/etc/Counter/data]: 

    Now you need to decide if you will allow the users to create datafiles
    for them automatically. If you allow, the counter datafile will be
    created for the user if it does not exist and a pre-determined counter
    number will be inserted to it. If you do not allow, you have to create
    the datafile for each user, provided that the data diectory has proper
    write permission.
    
    Allowing users to create datafile is very convenient, as you do not
    have to be asked all the time when someone decides to use the counter.
    But the dark side of this is, anyone will be able create datafiles in
    the data directory. The decision is yours.
    
* Allow automatic data file creation [y|n]? n

    Now you need to decide if you want to compile the program in strict
    mode. If you compile the program in strict mode, the browsers which
    do not return the environment variable HTTP_REFERER, will not be
    served, that is no access hit will be recorded, no time or date
    will be displayed. Instead, a string 888888 will be displayed. There
    are many browsers including NCSA Mosaic does not return that variable.

    The strict mode ensures that your counter data file can not be messed
    by accesing the counter remotely from a browser which does not return
    that variable. This strict mode is experimental at this time!

* Compile in strict mode [y|n]? y

    You need to enter the directory of the Log file.

*Log directory [/usr/local/etc/Counter/Log]: 

    You need to enter the name of the Log file.
    This file hold the error messages of the counter. It also
    logs if someone tried to access your counter remotely.

* Name of the log file [Count2.1.log]: 

    Ok, do you want the users to use the file rgb.txt for color name
    lookup? It is very inefficient to search this file every time the
    web page is loaded. If you answer yes, the color name
    will be looked up and used. If you answer no, the color will be
    looked up but instead of the counter image, the RGB value will
    be displayed and the user will be asked to use the RGB value
    instead. This will prevent users to use this file.

* Allow using the rgb.txt file[y|N]:? n

You entered:

CgiBinDir=/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin

Everything looks ok [y|n]? y
Great! creating header file config.h
creating variables template file ./Config.tmpl for the install program..
now run ./configure
