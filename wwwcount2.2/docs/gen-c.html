$ Gen-conf
    Welcome to the conf file generation procedure of Count 2.0

    Note: The counter program does not handle sub-masking, nor does this
    script. It creates a workable conf file for your host only, you have
    to edit it by hand if you want to add other hosts. The file will have
    enough comments in it to help you out. You also have to hand edit it
    for wildcard ignoring.

    First of all you must know your 
        1) fully qualified hostname, for example,
            foo.foobar.com

        2) IP address of your host, for example, 
            192.165.155.2 

        3) If your host has any nickname defined, for example,
            www.foobar.com. 

        4) If you want to ignore access hits from your own host.

Continue [y|n]? y
        
    No Error checking will be done with your hostname, therfore,
    you better make sure you are entering the fully qualifed hostname.
          
* Enter your fully qualified hostname [no default]: warm.semcor.com

    No Error checking will be done with your IP address, therfore,
    you better make sure you are entering the correct IP address.

* Enter your IP address [no default]: 192.160.166.1

* Does your host have any nickname [y|Y]:? y
* Enter your host's nickname [no default]: www.semcor.com
* Do you want to ignore access hits from your own host [y|n]? y
